# School

This is were I'll share all the courses, lessons and works I'm having, so my classmates can be inspired ;)

> Please note that it is not recommended to copy and paste my code without understanding it.

In [initDev](/initDev) you can find all the files related to the R1.01.

In [initDev/algo papier de merde](/initDev/algo-papier) you can find all the files related to the R1.01 made in TD. These are my shitty programs so don't take it too seriously.

In [BD / SQL](/bdsql) you can find all the files related to the sql course.

In [Introduction aux SE](/introSE) you can find some of the scripts I wrote for the OS Introduction lesson.

> There are some programs in [trash](/initDev/trash) that work, but aren't especially well written, so you can use them but they aren't as good as they probably could or should be.

Also note that all the programs starting with **td2** or **td3** aren't selfmade, I'm just copying what the teacher sent us, so it is obviously full of errors and very unoptimized.
